## Introduction

**Video Instance Segmentation** aims at **detecting, segmenting, and tracking every pixel of object instances simultaneously in a given video.**. 

**Video Instance Segmentation** (VIS) methods can be categorized as online, Semi-Online or Offline methods. 
- ***Online methods***  take as input a video frame by frame, detecting and segmenting objects per frame while tracking instances and optimizing results
across frames.
- ***Offline methods***  in contrast, take the whole video as input and generate the instance sequence of the entire video with a single step.
- ***Semi-online*** that focus on placing multiple frames in a short clip to strengthen intra-clip tracking similar to offline methods.
